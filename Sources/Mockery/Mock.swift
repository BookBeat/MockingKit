 This class can be inherited by mock classes that don't have
 to inherit another base class.
 
 Classes that must inherit another base class (e.g. a mocked
 system class) should implement `Mockable` and create a mock
 instance instead. This class implements `Mockable` by using
 itself as the mock.
 
 See `Mockable` for more information about what mocks can do.
