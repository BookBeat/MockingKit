 This class can be inherited by your mocks and provides them
 with full mocking capabilities.
 
 The class implements `Mockable` by using itself as mock. It
 saves you some code and makes things...nicer. If a mock has
 to inherit another class, just implement `Mockable` instead
 and add a `mock` property to it. The rest is identical.
 
 See `Mockable` for more information about what mocks can do.
